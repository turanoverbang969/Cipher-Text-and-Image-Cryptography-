## Usage üñ•Ô∏è
Once you have downloaded and set up the application, follow these steps to use it:

1. **Open the Application**: Launch the application by running the main Java file.
2. **Select Encryption or Decryption**: Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt text or images.
3. **Input Data**: For text, type your message. For images, select the file you wish to encrypt or decrypt.
4. **Execute**: Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to process your data.
5. **Save Output**: The application will prompt you to save the encrypted or decrypted file.

## How It Works üîç
### Text Encryption with RSA
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public-key cryptographic system that enables secure data transmission. In this project, RSA is used for encrypting and decrypting text messages. 

1. **Key Generation**: The user generates a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
2. **Encryption**: The plaintext message is transformed into ciphertext using the public key.
3. **Decryption**: The ciphertext is converted back to plaintext using the private key.

### Image Encryption with AES
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing data. 

1. **Key Generation**: A secret key is generated for both encryption and decryption.
2. **Encryption**: The image file is processed to create an encrypted version.
3. **Decryption**: The encrypted image can be reverted to its original form using the same key.
